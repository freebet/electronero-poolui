<strong>Webmining/Jsminer/bot-net Policy</strong></br>

There has been an increase in VPS, bot-net, and webminers, We will have to either ban and/or lock the payments for anything that is considered ddos/abusive traffic ! If it consists of bot-nets and Webminers.

If you have a high amount of workers that are legitimately yours. (At least 50 miners!), Use a proxy like <a href="https://github.com/Snipa22/xmr-node-proxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">xmr-node-proxy</a> . Its made to specificly  connect to our pool type and works very efficent!

This proxy has several advantages over other software.  It appears to the pool as a single miner and doesnt consume resources!
